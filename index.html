            <p>Coffee tastes better when it is <span class="bold">strong!</span></p>
            <p><span class="bold">Do you agree?</span></p>
            <div class="col">A 2017 umbrella review of meta-analyses found that drinking coffee is generally safe within usual levels of intake and is more likely to improve health outcomes than to cause harm at doses of 3 or 4 cups of coffee daily. Exceptions include possible increased risk in women having bone fractures, and a possible increased risk in fetal loss or decreased birth weight during pregnancy. Results were complicated by poor study quality, and differences in age, gender, health status, and serving size.</div>
            <h2>TYPES</h2>
            <p id="one">Coffee beans are the seeds of a fruit called coffee cherry. Coffee cherries grow on coffee trees from a genus of plants called Coffea. There are a wide variety of species of coffee plants, ranging from shrubs to trees.</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li><span class="bold">Types of Bean:</span>Most of us are familiar with arabica and robusta - the two main species of the Coffea genus. More recently, especially with the spread of the third wave of coffee culture, the arabica bean has been closely associated with superior quality. But there's also liberica - a rarer species that has gained a footing in the region.Making up between 60% to 80% of global production, the arabica bean is commonly accepted to be the first species of coffee to be cultivated in Arabia as its name suggests. They tend to be sweeter and fruitier with plenty of nuanced, light flavours.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li><span class="bold">Types of Roast:</span>The four types of coffee roasts are light roast, medium roast, medium-dark roast, and dark roast. Each of these roast levels has a different aroma, appearance, and flavor. Keep reading to learn all about the four types of coffee roasts!</li>
            </ul>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li><span class="bold">Types of Grind:</span>There's more to coffee than meets the eye. Whether you drink pour-over, drip, espresso, or the like, each brew requires a specific grind type to produce the desired flavor and consistency.When choosing a coffee, you need to know the different types of coffee grinds to achieve the best results.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li><span class="bold">Decaffeinated Coffee:</span>Decaf is short for decaffeinated coffee.It's coffee from coffee beans that have had at least 97% of their caffeine removed.There are many ways to remove caffeine from coffee beans. Most of them include water, organic solvents, or carbon dioxide (1Trusted Source).Coffee beans are washed in the solvent until the caffeine has been extracted from it, then the solvent is removed.Caffeine can also be removed using carbon dioxide or a charcoal filter — a method known as the Swiss Water Process.The beans are decaffeinated before they're roasted and ground. The nutritional value of decaf coffee should be almost identical to regular coffee, apart from the caffeine content.However, the taste and smell may become a little milder, and the color may change, depending on the method used.</li>
